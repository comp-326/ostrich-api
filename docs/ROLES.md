## Understanding Workspaces and Member Roles on Ostrich

Understand the difference between Viewers, Creators, Counsellor Lites, and Admins in our Workspace.

### Workspace

Every user account comes with a Workspace containing Appointments, Intakes, and Shared Library. Here users can collaborate with their team members in scheduling, publishing, haring, and completing appointments and inquiries together, depending on each team member's role (see below). Users can invite people to their Workspace,wants except Creator roles.

### Member roles

Viewers in a Workspace (free users)	* Can book appointments from the landing page, sign up/onboard themselves on mobile app and access all the mobile app features.

- Can discover folder profiles, react to, share and comment on folders/profiles, standouts and guides in the Mobile App, confirm/reschedule/cancel appointments.
- Can invite other Viewers to the Workspace.
- Can only use the mobile app, not the web app.
